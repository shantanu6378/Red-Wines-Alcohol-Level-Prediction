# Case-Study
Vinho Verde wine comes from a small region in Northern Portugal known for its high quality white, red and rose`s wine. The wines from this region are truly magnificent in taste and are known for its lower alcohol content. The red variant is known for its red and tannic color, mostly due to the use of Vinhão, Borraçal and Amaral grapes. Since wine is becoming increasingly popular across the world, sufficient certification and quality assessment is needed to standardize the making and selling of wines. Wine certification is usually assessed through physicochemical tests.
 
To make sure that the alcohol level of the red variant of Vinho Verde is up to the market standards, we need to understand the relationship of the alcohol level with the various physicochemical attributes obtained through the tests. Data on the physicochemical tests were collected and donated to the UCI repository for analysis. 

The purpose of this analysis is to take these physicochemical attributes and use them to model their relationship with the alcohol level of the red variant.
